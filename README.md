# Udacity-Project-6-Music-App
This application demonstrates the design and layout for the structure of a Music Player app. 
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.

## Requirements

#### App Design
- [x] The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.
- [x] The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.
- [x] The app contains 2 to 6 activities

#### Layout
- [x] The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.
- [x] Features in the app are clearly defined either by labelling or images. For example, a button to play music could use a universally recognized triangular "Play" symbol or could have the text label "Play".
- [x] Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.
- [x] The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
     - Text sizes are defined in sp
     - Lengths are defined in dp
     - Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

 #### Code Quality
- [x] All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named so that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
- [x] The code is properly formatted:
     - No unnecessary blank lines
     - No unused variables or methods
     - No commented out code
- [x] The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.

#### Functionality
- [x] The code runs without errors
- [x] Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.
- [x] Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.
- [x] App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.
- [x] Information about instances of the custom class are stored in an appropriate data structure (e.g. ArrayList, Array).
     -When the information needs to be displayed, it is efficiently retrieved (e.g. Looping).
- [x] Data about each song (or equivalent audio media such as podcast episode) should be stored in a custom class that contains at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name)
     -If images are included (e.g. Album Art), they are stored as drawables. All drawables are stored at multiple densities. Images are not required.
